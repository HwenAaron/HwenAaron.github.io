						<p>
							My passion for computing and technology stems from my visual impairment. Growing up with low vision, assistive technology played a huge role in my character development. Assistive technology figuratively opened my eyes to what I can accomplish despite my disability. As a result, I developed an extreme appreciation and fascination for technology; especially how it can be used in ways to enhance the lives of people. This interest in and fascination with technology and its applications never ceased, and it has since transformed into my career passion and focus. As an aspiring creator and engineer, I wish to develop something that will broaden and expand one’s horizon.
							<br>
							<br>
							This goal comes from my personal experience with various technologies. One of these technologies is the Transformer, which I start to use in college. The Transformer is a portable digital camera that streams the live feed on to my laptop, where I can manipulate it so fit my visual needs. With the Transformer, I was able to read the board for the first time! It completely changed my educational career outlook. Because of how heavily engineering courses relied on blackboard interactions and real-time processing with what is written on the board, drawing a graph, for example, I was hesitant of pursuing an engineering degree: in fear that I could not learn the material properly. The Transformer changed all that for me. It enables me to do something I was not able to do before, seeing the board, and as result opened a path for me that I never considered in the past. A degree in Computer Science and Engineering did not seem like a far-fetched dream anymore. With the Transformer, I am able to select courses and attend talks without worrying how blackboard intensive the course or talk might be. Of course, the Transformer did not solve all my problems in the classroom, but it solved one, and that is all that count. Without technologies such as the Transformer, I would not be where I am right now.
							<br>
							<br>
							Innovations such as the Transformer is what I strive to build. Since starting college I have meet people from all walks of life; form a mathematician who was paralyzed from the neck down that uses text-to-speech and eye-tracking technologies to complete her task to a blind software engineer who utilizes screen reader to code. All these people have said one thing in common, “if it wasn’t for X, I would not be where I am today”, and I want to create that ‘X’. I want to provide for the community what the community has provided for me; a solution to a problem.

						</h1>
							<p>
								It took me a while, but I finally finished rebuilding my website. <br> After reading online and talking to upperclassmen I thought it would be a good idea to learn so web development and make a portfolio personal website. make a portfolio personal website.
								<br><br>
								So I spent my winter break of freshman year learning HTML, CSS, and JS from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>. One of the milestone projects was to create a portfolio website and so I did, however, I did not really satisfied with how it turned out...I thought there was too much whitespace and I found kinda difficult to display the content.
								<br>
								 However, by the time I finished my website, my winter break is almost over so I did not have the time and a=nd energy to start all over. This was winter 2017 
								<br><br>
								Fast forward to Fall 2018. I was staffing at HackRU, and as an organizer I am not allowed to submit a hack so I thought to myself since I'm I might as well work on a personal project. And so I decided to finally rebuild my website. Also, the first website was deployed in a way that made it really difficult to update so all the more reason to scrap it and rebuild. 
								<br><br>
								I like clean and simple things and I wanted my website to reflect that. <br> And this is the final result :) 

								<br><br>
								P.S. I used git for this project so this website will be alot easier ot maintain and update :)
								<br><br>
								P.P.S. Wow this post turned out longer then I expected

								Yay, the website is live!
